# 🛒 Walmart Sales Forecasting & Analytics

This project analyzes historical sales data from Walmart stores to uncover patterns, evaluate performance, and build sales forecasts to support retail decision-making. Using Python, SQL, and Power BI, I explored sales trends, examined the impact of holidays, built a time-series forecast model, and created an interactive dashboard to present insights.

The goal of this project is to replicate how a data analyst would approach a real-world business problem from start to finish — using data to drive better planning, promotions, and inventory decisions.
